I am Pratik Sheth, a Senior AI/ML Engineer with 7+ years of experience spanning computer vision, MLOps, and cloud architecture. Currently leading the Image Analysis division at Polymerize's Material Informatics Platform, where I develop cutting-edge computer vision solutions using state-of-the-art architectures including ResNet, YOLO, SAM, and Diffusion Models.

My expertise encompasses the full spectrum of AI/ML engineering - from designing production-grade ML systems and implementing MLOps/LLMOps pipelines to architecting scalable cloud-native solutions on AWS. I have proven experience in deploying SOC2-compliant infrastructure across multiple geographical regions, managing Kubernetes clusters at scale, and building real-time data processing pipelines.

**Core Specializations:**
- **AI/ML Engineering**: Computer vision, deep learning, model deployment and monitoring
- **Cloud Architecture**: AWS infrastructure automation, Kubernetes orchestration, multi-region deployments  
- **MLOps/LLMOps**: End-to-end ML pipelines, automated versioning, testing, and monitoring
- **Data Engineering**: High-performance streaming architectures, distributed computing frameworks

I hold an MBA in Technology Management and a B.E. in Information Technology from Gujarat Technological University. My work spans diverse industries from material science and enterprise analytics to government healthcare systems, always with a focus on building scalable, production-ready solutions.

This portfolio showcases my journey through complex technical challenges and innovative solutions in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI/ML engineering and cloud technologies.
