<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the implementation a typical Fraud Detection Algorithm. It is not widely used because of its simplicity but we can use it to compare it with other different prediction algorithm and we can benchmark what needs to be done and what is required to be changed. The aim of this implementation is make a spark programer used to typical MLlib work around and process of cleaning/transforming/analysing data</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The algorithm is called Logistic Regression and There are enough article available online so I wouldn't be explaining it here.</p>
