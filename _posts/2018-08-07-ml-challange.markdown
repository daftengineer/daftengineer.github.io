<p style="text-align:justify;">Credit policies are one of the most important indicators of economic growth. Optimizing them is crucial thing to do for a Governor of Central bank of any economy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Credit policy include several rates which are tuned to ensure the growth. Here I have taken the case of Indian Economy and rates being considered are Repo Rate, Reverse Repo Rate, Cash Reserve Ratio, Statutory Liquidity ratio, Marginal standing Facility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To make changes in these rates we need to understand current liquidity of market and whether to suck out or inject money in market. This is typically done by doing Open Market Operations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we can learn this time series OMO data and how it changes pattern in rates. and we can predict in future how we can apply OMO activity in case of specific credit policy changes.</p>
