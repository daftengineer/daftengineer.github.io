<p style="text-align:justify;">Predicting the stock market prices has been well studied subject in whole data analytics field but the problem with stock market is, that is highly relient on the collective human behaviour and sentiment towards the market. Now volatility in market is dependent on human sentiment which is harder to quantify. The most impactful thing to human sentiment about the stock is news. In this project I will try to predict the stock market with the help of news and sentiment around it. </p>
