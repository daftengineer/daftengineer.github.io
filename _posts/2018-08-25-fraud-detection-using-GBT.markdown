<p style="text-align:justify;">Here, we are going to tackle the same problem as ML1 but with different algorithm. The algorithm is called Gradient Boosted Trees. It is type of decision tree algorithm optimising differential loss function by using boosting. Unlike last Project I will be using IntelliJ IDEA for development purposes. And the application will be submittable to spark cluster. So unlike last time I wont be able to show you the output of individual lines of code so instead I will be explaining the code and and show the output at the end.</p>
