  <p style="text-align:justify;">Deep Learning is most consequential algorithm of 21<sup>st</sup> century, there is no doubt about it but majority of newcomers in Machine learning field, find it really hard to grasp the concept of it. Here is just a small post in which I would like to explain the basics of deep learning and little bit of the detail about future of it, all with the example of making a tea. This might be alot more intuitive than a typical architectural example used by most of books out in market</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Here I have oversimplified the concept but the gist of it is accurate</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">We do optimisation in every decision in our life. In layman's term optimisation is trade off. We do trade of between work or life, spending or saving, present benefits vs future benefits etc. Now, to get the best results, we need to find the balance among all these. In a nutshell, all the machine learning algorithms are optimising the result we have got to the result we want. Now we are clear on what is optimisation and what is the goal of machine learning algorithm, now we can start with deep learning</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Imagine we are making world's best tea and we are given whole kitchen, full of all ingredients, whether we need them or not for making tea. Now imagine, Person who is making tea doesn't know what all ingredients are for and how much to use them. Only way to know the ingredients is by tasting the tea made by him. Now chef would mix random things and give it to us and we will say whether it was good of bad. We have list of things, we want from a tea to have in order to consider it the best. those things are </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Color</li>
    <li>Taste</li>
    <li>Consistency</li>
    <li>Temperature</li>
  </ul>
