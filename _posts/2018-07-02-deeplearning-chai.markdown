  <p style="text-align:justify;">Deep Learning is most consequential algorithm of 21<sup>st</sup> century there is no doubt about it but majority of newcomers in Machine learning field find it really hard to grasp the concept of it. Here is just a small post in which I would like to explain the basics of deep learning and little bit of the detail about future of it, all with the example of making a tea. This might be alot more intuitive than a typical architectural example used by most of books out in market</p>
