<div style="color:black;"><p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this project, I will try different approach to data analysis. Exploration of batch data is okay but here, I am going to use streaming platform like kafka in order to simulate the streaming environment and use spark to analyse the upcoming data. There are 5 goals for the exploration which are as below:</p>
<p>1) Which state had highest pollution yearly?<br />
   2) Which cities were most polluted yearly?<br />
   3) Highest concentration of pollutant in the state.<br />
   4) Which observation method was most used yearly?<br />
</p>
