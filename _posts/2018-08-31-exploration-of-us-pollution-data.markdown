<p style="text-align:justify;">Environmental Protection Agency of United States conducts air pollution measurements of many areas in order to keep track on pollution level. In this project, I will be doing an explorative analysis of it. It will be in Spark REPL. There are 5 goals for the exploration which are as below:</p>
<p>1) Which state had highest pollution yearly?<br />
   2) Which cities were most polluted yearly?<br />
   3) Highest concentration of pollutant in the state.<br />
   4) Which observation method was most used yearly?<br /></p>
   <p style="text-align:justify;">The available data, we have, has around 75 lakh rows so it is huge dataset. Schema of the data is given below.
