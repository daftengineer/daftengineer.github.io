 <p style="text-align:justify;">In this project, I will try to find out concentration of accident in banglore. </p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">Finding an accident hotspot is really important task for any urban planner. It provides us with information that which are has unusal amount of traffic accidents. I have sensor data available with me which measures speed and gps location of accident. Using that I found 36 places where there is unusal number of traffic accidents.</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">Finding accident hotspot is basically a clustering problem. Here accidents tend to cluster in some location and those needs to be in focus of attention. For this task, I have use "Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise"(DBSCAN) Algorithm.</p>
